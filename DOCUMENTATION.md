# Introduction

This code is a simple implementation of a music playlist and an MP3 cutter. The playlist class uses the `Music` class to represent individual tracks in the playlist, and provides functions to add, delete, and manage the tracks. The `shorter` function cuts a specified portion of an MP3 file and saves the result to a new file.

is currently playing

- **build_str()**: returns a string representation of the class properties


## Class Playlist

##### A class that manages a list of music tracks and implements basic functionalities such as playing, pausing, and stopping music.

### Properties

- **name**: A string that represents the name of the playlist.

- **current**: The current music track that is being played.
- **index**: An integer that represents the current music track's index in the playlist.
- **loop**: A boolean that indicates whether the playlist should loop back to the first track after all tracks have been played.
- **auto**: A boolean that indicates whether the playlist should automatically start playing the next track after the current track has finished.
- **playlist**: A list of Music objects that represent the music tracks in the playlist.

### Methods

- **\_\_init__(self, name: str = "playlist", playlist: list = [], loop: bool = False, auto: bool = False)**: The constructor of the class that initializes the class properties. The name, loop, and auto parameters are optional and have default values. The playlist parameter is a list of strings or Music objects.

- **get_name()**: returns the name of the playlist.

- **get_playlist()**: returns the playlist.

- **get_current()**: returns the current music track.

- **get_index()**: returns the current music track's index in the playlist.

- **get_current_timer()**: returns the current music track's duration.

- **str_timer()**: returns the current time in the format minutes:seconds or hours:minutes:seconds depending on the length of the track.

- **is_auto()**: returns whether the playlist is set to play tracks automatically.

- **is_over()**: returns whether the playlist has reached the end of all tracks and there is no more music to play.

- **set_name(name: str)**: sets the name of the playlist to the specified string.

- **add_music(music: Music)**: appends a Music object to the end of the playlist.

- **next()**: plays the next music track in the playlist.

- **previous()**: plays the previous music track in the playlist.

- **get_next_music()**: return the next music in queue (None if out of range)

- **get_previous_music()**: return the previous music in queue (None if out of range)

- **clear()**: clear the playlist from all songs

- **init()**: initializes the playlist and starts playing the first music track.

- **play()**: play the current track

- **stop()**: stop the current track

- **pause()**: pause the current track
